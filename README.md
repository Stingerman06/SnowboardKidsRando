# SnowboardKidsRando
A basic randomizer for Snowboard Kids for the N64. Uses the console window.


## Planned Features

Coins and Weapons|Game Music
Racers|Shot/Speed/Trick Game/Time Trial Scoreboard*
Racers Boards|Required 'G' for Snowboards

* - Found the data locations, still figuring out which is which. Not very organized.

### Options for generating game

1. Patching ROM
2. CRE Patching
3. GameShark Code Generation
4. Generate a patch file.
5. Title Screen Graphic Change

#### It's a lot to do but I'll only be working towards the following for now.

1. Patching the ROM directly
2. Randomizing Coins and Weapons on the field
